- **Styling**: SCSS is used for styling. No external UI library is used; all components are built from scratch.
- **Features**:
  - This project demonstrate the file & folder structures.
  - I have considered all the edge cases while developing this project. Folder can have files & Folders. Folders can be empty folder. Folder can have single File child & so on.
  - Breadcrumb on the to show where exactly we are present in the Folder tree. Click a perticular element in breadcrumb takes us directly to that folder.
  - Files & folders can be distinguished with the help of the icon on the left. On clicking the folder folder opens, but on clicking the files users are redirected to the file link.
  - Activity on every click is stored in the local storage with current time. Which is fetched and displayed in the activity log section.
  - This app is fully responsive and also works on mobile.
